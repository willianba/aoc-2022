# Advent of Code 2022

I'm learning rust and decide to try AoC with this language.

Any solutions here are not optimal and not even good. I'm trying to explore and test new stuff so don't bother yourself if you see shit code ðŸ¤£

## How to run

Have rust installed, go to the solution folder, and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

If you wanna run an optimized build:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Shortcuts available as well:

```bash
cargo r -r
```
